        The numbers \(4x\), \(2x-3\) and \(4x-3\) are consecutive terms in a linear sequence. Find the value of \(x\).

      \begin{MySolutionBox}
        A linear sequence is like an arithmetic sequence except that the terms of the sequence need not be integers. There is a constant difference \(d\) between terms. If we suppose that \(4x\) is the first term of the sequence we have:\par\vspace{4mm}
          \begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|c}
             n & \(1\) & \(2\) & \(3\) & \(4\) & \(\cdots\)\\ \hline
             \(n^{th}\) term & \(4x\) & \(2x-3\) & \(4x-3\) & & \\
           \end{tabular}\par\vspace{4mm}
          Now, \(d\), is the difference between each successive term, so
          \begin{align*}
            d &= (4x-3)-(2x-3) \qquad\text{  and  }\qquad d = (2x-3) - 4x\\
            \text{So equating,  }\qquad (4x-3)-(2x-3) &= (2x-3) - 4x\\
            2x &= -2x -3\\
            4x &= -3 \implies x= -\frac{3}{4}\\
          \end{align*}
          We have our solution but we should check by substituting in for \(x\).\par\vspace{4mm}
           \begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|c}
             n & \(1\) & \(2\) & \(3\) & \(4\) & \(\cdots\)\\ \hline
             \(n^{th}\)\; term & \(4x\) & \(2x-3\) & \(4x-3\) & & \\
             \(n^{th}\)\; term & \(-3\) & \(-\frac{9}{2}\) & \(-6\) & &\\
           \end{tabular}\par\vspace{4mm}
           We can see that there is a constant difference of \(d=-\frac{3}{2}\).
