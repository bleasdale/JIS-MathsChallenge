      A game begins with 100 people standing in a circle. One person holds a ball, call them person Number 1, and then number the other players consecutively anticlockwise: the person to the ball-holder's left is No. 100, to their right stands person No. 2.\par
      The person holding the ball throws it over the head of the first person on their right, the person on the other side catches it. So at the start No. 1 throws to No. 3.\par
      A person skipped by the ball, immediately leaves the circle for tea and chocolate biscuits.\par
      So person No. 3 would be the next holder of the ball. No. 3 throws to No. 5 and No. 4 leaves the circle.\par
      The process continues until there is one person left in the circle. If there are only two people left, the person holding the ball throws to themselves, eliminating the other person.\par
      What is the number of the last person in the circle?\par

      \begin{MySolutionBox}
      \underline{Solution by playing the full game:} Each line of the table shows the people left in the circle after that round:\par
        \begin{description}[leftmargin=!,labelwidth=\widthof{\bfseries Round 7:},labelindent=1em,labelsep=2em,itemsep=0.1pt]
          \item[\textbf{Round 1:}] 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99
          \item[Round 2:] 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, 81, 85, 89, 93, 97
          \item[Round 3:] 1, 9, 17, 25, 33, 41, 49, 57, 65, 73, 81, 89, 97
          \item[Round 4:] 9, 25, 41, 57, 73, 89
          \item[Round 5:] 9, 41, 73
          \item[Round 6:] 9, 73
          \item[Round 7:] 73
        \end{description}
        So person No. 73 is the last one in the circle.\par
        \underline{Solution by reasoning:} For an even number of people starting the game, half are out after the first round.\par
        So if the number of people playing is a power of \(2\), the person holding the ball at the beginning will be the last person in the circle.\par
        The closest power of \(2\), less than \(100\) is \(64\). So if we can see who is holding the ball once \(36\) people have been eliminated, we have found the answer.\par
        The \(36^{t}\) person to be eliminated must be No. 72, and No. 73 has just caught the ball.\par
        Since there are now \(64\) people in the circle, the holder of the ball, No. 73, will be the last person in the circle.\par
