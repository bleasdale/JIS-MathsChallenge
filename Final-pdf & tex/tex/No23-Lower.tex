     The pages of a book are numbered; \(1,\;2,\;3,\ldots\)\par
     It takes \(852\) digits to number all the pages of the book.\par
     What is the number of the last page of the book?\par
      \iftoggle{SOLUTION}{%conditional output begin
      \begin{MySolutionBox}
        From page 1 to page 9 we need \(9\) digits.\par
        From page 10 to page 99 we need \(90\times 2=180\) digits. \(189\) digits in total so far.\par
        We have \(852-189=663\) digits left, and we have up to page 99 so far.\par
        From page 100 to page 999 we would need \(900\times 3=2700\) digits.\par
        With \(663\) digits we can number \(663\div 3=221\) three-digit pages.\par
        Starting with page \(100\) that means we would reach page \(220\).
