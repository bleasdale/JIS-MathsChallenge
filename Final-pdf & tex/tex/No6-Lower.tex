      \begin{MySolutionBox}
        The shaded square has area \(\SI{1}{\square\cm}\) so it has sides of length \(\SI{1}{\cm}\).\par
        Let the length of the side of the largest square be \(a\). Then we can see that the next largest square must have side \(a-1\) because the shaded square on top of it exactly reaches to the top of the largest square. By the same reasoning the third largest square has side \(a-2\) and the smallest unshaded square has side \(a-3\). Now we can find two expressions for the distance across the diagram left to right.
        \begin{align*}
          Y &= X\\
          (a-1) + a &= (a-2) + (a-3) + h\\
          2a - 1 &= 2a -5 + h\\
          -1 &= -5 + h\\
          h &= 4
        \end{align*}
